# ISO & Magisk Module Builder for Genymobile&reg; Tools
This program downloads, extracts, injects and creates the ISO file required for the Magisk Module GMT/OP3T. Then, builds and packages Magisk ModuleGMT/OP3T for install as a Magisk Module.
Currently only supports Windows platforms.

## Pre-requisites
* OnePlus 3T phone.
* Makisk Manager installed on phone.
* USB Drivers installed on the computer.
* ADB Debugging enabled on phone.
* Computer authorized to make use of USB ADB Debugging.

## Download

Download the [latest release][latest] and install via Magisk Manager.

[latest]: https://github.com/JMVS/gmt-mm-builder/releases/latest

### Caveats
* Once properly installed as a Magisk Module, when connected to a computer, you should select Transfer Files option for Windows to show the ISO as a drive. This is the same behavior as the original ISO shipped with the phone.

## Build
1. [Download/clone repo](https://github.com/JMVS/gmt-mm-builder/archive/master.zip).
2. Extract archive to a **writable** folder.
3. Run **"buildgmt.cmd"** and wait it to finish.
4. If everything went OK, you should see a **"gmt-mm.zip"** file.
5. Copy **"gmt-mm.zip"** to your phone.
6. Install as a Magisk Module.

### Additional options
* You can place original usb_drivers.iso file from your phone inside folder original_iso to skip extracting it from your phone.
* If you choose to extract usb_drivers.iso file from your phone, you should already have USB drivers installed, ADB debugging on and computer authorized, otherwise pulling file will fail.

### Pre-requisites
* Windows OS
* Internet connection on the computer.
* Available space on disk to build ISO and Magisk Module (approx. ~50-60 MiB).
